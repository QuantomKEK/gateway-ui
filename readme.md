Retrieved from the venerable [Original Swarm Client](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm), this is the single HTML page we started using before Bee had directory support.

The old Swarm gateway was delivered in a mishmash of Go templates and inline styles and javascript. I worked on the actual website in a brutally similistic and naive mode and then copy pasted it into what was already due to a mixture of time constraints, the lay of the land when i found it and my own personal golang learning curve which was most steep at that point.

The historical record of that can be found [here](https://github.com/significance/swarm-progress-bar)

Contributions welcome ;D
